# Markdown Previewer
v2 -- [live site](http://profuse-toys.surge.sh/) - deployed with [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh/)

I had a few goals for this project refactor, including working locally with React, converting component to functional based application with Hooks, and some style updates. Rather than using the web CDN link for 'marked,' there is a 'use-marked-hook' function that made the rendering much easier to set up. Happy to say each goal point had passed and know this tool can be useful for markdown based blog posts similar to [dev.to](https://dev.to/haleyelder).

---------------------------------------
### Changelog

v1 on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/haleyelder/full/wOGxZV). Utilized 'marked' CDN library and pass specified tests to pass for the freeCodeCamp project to pass.
